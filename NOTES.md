## step 1

First step is to establish what questions I have or what I want to look into to fully understand  how it came to be that Man City won the premier League:

- How did teams fair offensively?
- How did teams fair defensively?
- Analyze disciplinary records for teams

## step 2
In this second step I'm thinking that I should organize the data into categories to to define the type of data they hold within them. The three main categories are as follows:

### Offensive
- big_chance_team.csv
- player_expected_assists.csv
- player_expected_goals.csv
- possession_percentage_team.csv
- team_goals_per_match.csv
- touches_in_opp_box_team.csv

### Defensive
- clean_sheet_team.csv
- goals_conceded_team_match.csv
- saves_team.csv
- won_tackle_team.csv

### Disciplinary
- player_fouls_committed.csv
- player_red_cards.csv
- total_red_card_team.csv
- total_yel_card_team.csv ‚ùå (upon looking through the tables `total_yel_card_team.csv` and `total_red_card_team.csv` had the exact same data, makimg it redundant info, leading me to drop `total_ryel_card_team.csv`)

The remaining tables `pl_table_2023_24.csv` & `pl_table_xg_2023_24.csv` are  tables that show the final Premier League Table and the latter is a table holding predictive values for goals, points, and etc.

## step 3
Third step in this process is to just see what data I have available to me, how it all relates to eachother or doesn't relate, if it helps me answer the questions i've posed and to essentially trim the fat if any tables dont aide me in this cause.
