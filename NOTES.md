First step is to establish what questions I have or what I want to look into to fully understand  how it came to be that Man City won the premier League:

## step 2
In this second step I'm thinking that I should organize the data into categories to to define the type of data they hold within them. The three main categories would:

### Offensive
- big_chance_team.csv
- player_expected_assists.csv
- player_expected_goals.csv
- possession_percentage_team.csv
- team_goals_per_match.csv
- touches_in_opp_box_team.csv

### Defensive


## step 3
Third step in this process is to just see what data I have available to me, how it all relates to eachother or doesn't relate, if it helps me answer the questions i've posed and to essentially trim the fat if any tables dont aide me in this cause.
